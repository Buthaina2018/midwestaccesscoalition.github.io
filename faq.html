<h4>Does MAC provide abortions?</h4>
<p>No, we do not. We assist people coming to and from procedures.</p>
 
<h4>Is MAC trans-inclusive?</h4>
<p>Yes, we most definitely are. We are fully aware that people of all kinds experience unwanted pregnancies and are supportive of choice. We go out of our way to ensure that everyone feels comfortable, understood, and supported.</p>

<h4>Minor without parental involvement?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, those under the age of 18 must notify their parent or guardian in order to get an abortion under the law. For minors choosing to access abortion who do not want to tell their parents, the <a href="http://ilbypasscoordinationproject.org/">ACLU Judicial Bypass Project</a> can help.</p>
