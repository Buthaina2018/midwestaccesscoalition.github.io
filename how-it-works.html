<h3>How does MAC work?</h3>
 
<p>MAC is a non-traditional abortion fund. Essentially, this means that we do not provide financial assistance for abortion procedures, but rather, assist with other costs and difficulties associated with getting abortions.</p>
 
<p>If you are traveling to Chicago for an abortion from another city or state, we can help ease your journey. If needed, MAC can book your travel arrangements to get to the city (for example, bus or train ticket, or reimburse for gas money). A MAC volunteer can meet you at the bus or train station and escort you to a volunteer's home where you will stay during your visit.</p>
 
<p>This eliminates the costly expense of staying in a hotel. It is our goal to make your stay go as smoothly as possible. MAC also helps reduce costs of food and medication.</p>

<p>If you need to travel to Chicago to access safe and legal abortion services, we host and help with transportation.</p>

<h3>Parental notification law</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, women under the age of 18 must notify their parent or guardian in order to get an abortion under the law. For minors choosing to access abortion who do not want to tell their parents, the <a href="http://ilbypasscoordinationproject.org/">ACLU Judicial Bypass Project can help</a>.
