<h1>We're the Midwest Access Coalition.</h1>
<h3>Our mission is to provide accommodation and support to those who travel to Chicago to access a safe, legal abortion when prohibitive legislation limits access closer to home. Read more about MAC's <a href="overview.html">here</a>.</h3>
<h3>We have a vision of a world in which women have access to safe, free, legal abortions wherever they live.</h3>
