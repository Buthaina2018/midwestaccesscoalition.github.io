## Midwest Access Coalition site

The files you can click through here are the live site!

Any .markdown or .md file is safe for you to edit. These will generally start with something like...

```
---
title: page-title
layout: some-layout
---
```

The general structure of the site is as follows:

###Pages shown in the nav bar
* `index (home)` - states mission, values, featured links
* `connect` - facebook, twitter feeds, contact form
* `resources` --> similar organizations + descriptions
* `how it works` --> description of what patients & volunteers should expect --> link for vol, link for patient
* `join us` --> mailing list, volunteer
* `team` --> staff bios, board members --> goals, vision
* `how to help` --> links to donate, volunteer, sign up for our mailing list, come to next event

###Separate Pages, but not on nav bar
* donate
* volunteer form
* contact form
* newsletters
