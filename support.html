<h3>If you are traveling to Chicago for an abortion from another city or state, we can help ease your journey.</h3> 
<h4>If needed, MAC can book your travel arrangements to get to the city (for example, bus or train ticket, or reimburse for gas money).</h4>
<h4>A MAC volunteer can meet you at the bus or train station and escort you to a volunteer's home where you will stay during your visit.</h4>
