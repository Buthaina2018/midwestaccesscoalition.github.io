<h3>If you are traveling to Chicago for an abortion from another city or state, we can help ease your journey.</h3> 
<h4>If needed, MAC can book your travel arrangements to get to the city (for example, bus or train ticket, or reimburse for gas money).</h4>
<h4>A MAC volunteer can meet you at the bus or train station and escort you to a volunteer's home where you will stay during your visit.</h4>


<h4>Parental notification law</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, women under the age of 18 must notify their parent or guardian in order to get an abortion under the law. For minors choosing to access abortion who do not want to tell their parents, the <a href="http://ilbypasscoordinationproject.org/">ACLU Judicial Bypass Project</a> can help.</p>
