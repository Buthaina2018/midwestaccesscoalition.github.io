####Our VISION is one of a world where women have access to safe, free, legal abortions wherever they live.

##Our VALUES
We are compassionate and respectful of people and their decisions.
We believe in providing practical support that improves lives.

We are pro choice.

We believe in opening dialogue around the factors that create the need of abortion.

We value the diversity of people making reproductive rights decisions.

Of course, we'd like to see the Midwest Access Coalition become obsolete, and to that end...

##Our GOALS
* Remove financial barriers for women coming to Chicago seeking abortions
* Increase support to women seeking abortions
* Normalize conversations about abortion
* Promote conversations about reproductive rights in relation to sexism, racism and classism
* Activate a network of MAC volunteers, and
* Advocate for pro-choice legislation in the Midwest.
